        <P class="para-one">Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. It encompasses a wide range of topics, from basic neural processes to complex human and animal behaviors. Psychologists seek to understand how the mind works, how people perceive the world, how they think, learn, feel, and interact with others, and how they cope with stress and other challenges.</P>

       <h2>4-Social Psychology:</h2>
       <p>Social psychology is the scientific study of how individuals think, feel, and behave in social contexts. It explores how people's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. Social psychology bridges the gap between psychology and sociology by focusing on individual behavior within group settings.</p>

            <li><span>Example:</span> Time of day when the memory test is taken, the type of material to be memorized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5-Experimental Group:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The group of participants that receives the treatment or manipulation of the independent variable.</li>

        <h3>Types of Experimental Designs:</h3>

        <h4>1-Between-Subjects Design:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Different participants are assigned to each condition of the independent variable.</li>
            <li><span>Example:</span> One group sleeps 8 hours, another group sleeps 6 hours, and another group sleeps 4 hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2-Within-Subjects Design:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The same participants experience all conditions of the independent variable.</li>
            <li><span>Example:</span> Each participant sleeps for 4, 6, and 8 hours on different nights, and their memory retention is measured after each condition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3-Factorial Design:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiments that involve two or more independent variables.</li>
            <li><span>Example:</span> Studying the effects of both sleep duration and caffeine intake on memory retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Importance of Experimental Controls:</h3>

        <h4>1-Randomization:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Random assignment of participants to different conditions to minimize biases and ensure groups are comparable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2-Blinding:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Single-Blind:</span> Participants are unaware of the condition they are in to prevent their expectations from influencing the results.</li>
            <li><span>Double-Blind:</span> Both participants and researchers are unaware of the conditions to prevent bias in administering treatments or interpreting results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3-Placebo:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In drug studies, a placebo is an inactive substance given to the control group to account for the effects of mere participation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3>

        <h4>1-Informed Consent:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants must be fully informed about the nature of the experiment, potential risks, and their right to withdraw at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2-Debriefing:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing participants with full information about the study’s purpose and procedures after their involvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3-Confidentiality:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring that participants' data is kept confidential and used only for the purposes of the research.</li>
        </ul>
